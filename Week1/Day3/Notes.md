Day 3 Notes
Objects, Fields, and Records
Object
An object in Salesforce is similar to a database table that stores related information.

Examples:

Student
Faculty
Course
Department
Field
A field stores a specific type of information inside an object.

Examples:

Student Name
Email
Age
Course Name
Record
A record is a single entry inside an object.

Example:

Name	Age	Department
Rahul	20	CSE
Standard vs Custom Objects
Standard Objects
Objects already provided by Salesforce.

Examples:

Account
Contact
Opportunity
Lead
Custom Objects
Objects created according to business requirements.

Examples:

Student
Faculty
Course
Department
Relationships in Salesforce
Relationships are used to connect objects.

Lookup Relationship
Creates a loose connection between objects.

Examples:

Student → Department
Faculty → Department
One-to-Many Relationship
One record can be connected to multiple records.

Examples:

One Department can have many Students
One Faculty can teach many Courses
Junction Object
Used to create a many-to-many relationship.

Example:

StudentCourse object connects Students and Courses
Formula Fields
Formula fields automatically calculate values.

Examples
Full Name
Remaining Seats
Percentage
Benefits

Keeps values updated automatically
Example Formula
Full Name: First_Name__c & " " & Last_Name__c

Remaining Seats: Total_Seats__c - Enrolled_Students__c

Percentage: (Marks_Obtained__c / Total_Marks__c) * 100

Validation Rules
Validation rules prevent invalid data from being saved.

Examples
1. Email Cannot Be Empty
Prevents records without email addresses.

2. Student Age Cannot Be Negative
Prevents invalid age values.

Validation: Age__c < 0

3. Course Seats Cannot Exceed Limit
Prevents overbooking courses.

Why Structured Data Matters
Companies need structured data because:

Large data becomes easier to manage
Reports become accurate
Searching and filtering become faster
Duplicate records are reduced
Team collaboration improves
Random spreadsheets become difficult to maintain when data grows.

Salesforce as a Metadata-Driven Platform
Salesforce is called metadata-driven because:

Most customizations are done without coding
Admins can create objects, fields, rules, and automation easily
Applications can be modified quickly according to business needs
